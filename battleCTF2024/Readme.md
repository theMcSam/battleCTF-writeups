Flag: `battleCTF{HereWeGo}`

### Invite Code
This challenge was a bit tricky because many i overlooked the message in the #notification channel before the CTF began. Luckily, after sometime i discovered it.

First thing i did was to pick up the encoded data and place it into `cyberchef`.    
![Cyber Chef Hex Data Decode](https://github.com/theMcSam/battleCTF-writeups/blob/main/battleCTF2024/Invite%20Code/images/invite_code_cyberchef_from_hex.png)   
We can see that the data provided was a hex dump and `cyberchef` decoded it successfully resulting in a contatenation of base64 string and a link. The base64 string just leads us to the Rick Roll video in YouTube and so that isn't vert relevant.

The other link `https://bugpwn.com/invite.ini` leads us to a page where some data is hosted on the website.
